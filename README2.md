# Building a Portfoliio Page



## Description

This weeks project was to make a portfolio page, including an About me, Work and Contact me section.
In HTML file, I included the proper naming id and class conventions and semantics
In CSS file, I added style, color and animations when hovering over images and links
I also added media screen, to make the page responsive to whatever device is being used, be it PC, tablet or phone.
